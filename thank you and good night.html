        Well, it's been a wild ride<br>
    And we've enjoyed every insane minute of it<br>
    We don't know what the future holds<br>
    But we're grateful for every moment we got to spend with you<br>
    And remember, it's not really goodbye<br>
    'Cause we'll probably see most of you very soon<br>
    Until then<br>
    <p></p>
    It's been a blast, been a slice<br>
    Been a hell of a ride (woah-oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
    We've had some laughs, had some fights<br>
    Even some of us cried (woah-oh, oh-oh)<br>
    But all good things must come to an end<br>
    And I guеss this is our time<br>
    So, so long, farewell<br>
    And wе'll see you on the other side<br>
    <p></p>
    But it's not goodbye forever<br>
    'Cause we're all down here together<br>
    And we hope we get to see you when you die<br>
    <p></p>
    We may be monsters, creeps, and killers<br>
    But we'll miss you just the same<br>
    And don't be sad, we're stuck for eternity<br>
    In constant torture, fire, and pain<br>
    'Cause there's love, and joy, and laughter<br>
    Who cares if it's wrong or right?<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you and good night<br>
    <p></p>
    Good night, good night<br>
    Thank you and good night<br>
    Good night, good night<br>
    Hahaha<br>
    <p></p>
    What a trip, never had such a natural high, haha<br>
    <p></p>
    And I'd buy you a drink<br>
    But I'm not that kind of a guy, screw off<br>
    (Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh)<br>
    <p></p>
    You're the bomb, you're the blow-out, no doubt<br>
    The cherry of my eye<br>
    <p></p>
    And though you gotta check out<br>
    I'll keep it neat and tidy till next time (bye bye)<br>
    <p></p>
    But we won't leave you with nothing<br>
    At least we hope we gave you something<br>
    Even if that something made your conscience cry<br>
    <p></p>
    If anyone out there can hear me<br>
    I have one last thing to say<br>
    Despite the unideal location<br>
    We hope you enjoyed your stay<br>
    'Cause there was love, and joy, and laughter<br>
    It's not perfect, but we tried<br>
    <p></p>
    We had so much fun, so thank you<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you and good night<br>
    <p></p>
    We may be monsters, creeps, and killers<br>
    But we'll miss you just the same<br>
    And don't be sad, we're stuck for eternity<br>
    In constant torture, fire, and pain<br>
    'Cause there's love, and joy, and laughter<br>
    Who cares if it's wrong or right?<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you<br>
    We had so much fun, so thank you and good night<br>
    Thank you and good night<br>
    <p></p>
    Good night, good night<br>
    Thank you and good night<br>
    Good night, good night (da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)<br>
    'Cause there's love, and joy, and laughter<br>
    Who cares if it's wrong or right?<br>
    <p></p>
    We had so much fun, so thank you and good night<br>
